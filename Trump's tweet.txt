trump,@Foffy_the_Sheep @Sailor_Viola And while that's true it's a measure of degrees. Trump is doing lasting irreparable damage on TOP of what would have already been the maintained harm. We could be looking at another global recession or even depression due to his stupid trade wars.

It isn‚Äôt disrespectful but a feeling or recognition he Trump is one of us.

He understands the needs of people to be able to earn a living.
